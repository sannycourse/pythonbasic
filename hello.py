String Method Practise Tasks: 1

my_string = "  Welcome to Python Bootcamp! Let's learn Python.  "

Remove leading and trailing spaces
Convert to lowercase
Convert to uppercase
Replace "Python" with "JavaScript"
Count how many times "Python" appears
Check if the string ends with "."
Split the string by "!"
Print the length of the original string



Task 2: 
name = "John"
age = 25
country = "India"

Format and print this sentence using an f-string:
"My name is John, I am 25 years old and I live in India."


Task 3:
Write a for loop to print each letter in the string "Artificial Intelligence" and also count length and also how many vowels are there in it? - 3 questions



Task 4: If-Else Practice
Create a variable score = 85
ðŸ”¹ Write a condition:
If score is 90 or above â†’ print "Excellent"
If score is between 70 and 89 â†’ print "Good"
If score is below 70 â†’ print "Needs Improvement"


Task 5: String Slicing Practice
Use this string: course_name = "Python Programming Language"

Print:
"Python" using slicing
"Programming" using slicing
"Language" using slicing
The reversed string of course_name
